  <appearance> With no need for their individual teeth for processing foot, the teeth of the host body amalgamates into a small solid line
    with their canines becoming oversized on both roof and floor of the mouth. These then become super sharp and strong allowing
      for piercing of thigns such as vents or body tissue to get to the core of the heat easier.

  <feed source="03" style="vampire" environmentFeed="true">When feeding cyro-daemons open their mouths wide and breath deep. Intaking heat via a cold blue micro-tornado appearing
    from the source to the daemon. They exhale from the grills below the point of their wings being attached and then down
    the side of their upperchest. This allows them to gouge their heat-bladder with heat without having to stop for respiration.

  <mobility type="+space">
    Cryo-Daemons may exploit their hosts body with the heat bladder, granting super strength (at the cost of heat) and 
    flight through the daemon's wings. Through a combination of the heatbladder, wings and gill like features, they may use their 
    heat to propell themselves through space. Needing only to maintain speed minimally in space, and living off the heat in their 
    overgorged bladder, or taking a heatsrouce with them (such as a nuclear battery or the like), swarms of Cryo-Daemons
    may traverse space once their current location has been drained of all sources of heat.

  <blurb>A dark pale blue, cryo-daemons are similar to vampires, in that they feed on heat.</blurb>
